## 2023 Recap
1. Basic Structure.
2. How to handle Errors:
	1. Logs.
	2. Alerts and Monitoring.
	3. Circuit braker
	4. Gracefull degradations
	5. timeouts and retries.
3. CI - Using Docker and Github Actions
4. CD - Using Docker, Docker Registry and Github Actions.


## Continuous Deployment:
1. Build an Image from a Merge for a Pull request
2. Push an Image to a registry (Use Docker hub)
3. Login via SSH to a EC2 Instance
4. Run the Docker instance with the new version.


### 1. Build an Image from a Merge for a Pull Request

**Assumption**: You have a GitHub repository and a Docker hub repository with your application code and a Dockerfile.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Merge the Pull Request**: First, merge the pull request into your main branch.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Ensure you have a Dockerfile in the root of your repository.
   - Build the image with a tag:
     ```bash
     docker build -t your-username/your-app:latest .
     ```

### 2. Push an Image to a Registry (Docker Hub)

**Prerequisites**: Docker Hub account and Docker installed on your machine.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Log in to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Tag Your Image** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   docker tag your-app:latest your-username/your-app:latest
   ```

3. **Push the Image to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker push your-username/your-app:latest
   ```
