# Agents

We are going to build an Agent that is able to solve a Maze.

Example of a maze:

```
X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X
S O X O O O X O O O O O O O X
X O X O X O X O X X X X X O X
X O X O X O O O X O O O X O X
X O O O X X X X X O X O O O X
X X X O X O O O O O X X X O X
X O O O X O X X X X X O O O X
X O X O O O O O O O X O X O X
X O X X X X X O X O O O X O X
X O O O O O X O X X X O X O X
X X X X X O X O O O X O X O X
X O O O X O O O X O X O O O X
X O X O X O X X X O X X X O X
X O X O O O O O O O O O O O E
X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X
```

S = Start position
E = Exit of the maze
0 = Open Path
X = Wall

## Sensors

A sensor is a way that an agent has to interact with the environment, in this case is the ability of the agent to ask if the cells contiguos to the agent, are open paths or walls.

## Actuators
An Actuator is the ability of an Agent to interact with the environment, in this case to move accross the maze.

## Memory
A memory is an important aspect of the maze, and is the capacity to know the past, know the decisions made in the past and a way to interact with it.
